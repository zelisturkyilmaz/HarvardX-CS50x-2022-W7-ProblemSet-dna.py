# CS50's Introduction to Computer Science
## HarvardX - CS50x
### Week 7 Problem Set - dna.py
<hr>


### Assignment and Requirements:
Write and execute ```dna.py``` program that identifies to whom a sequence of DNA belongs.

Program should behave per the example below:

```
$ python dna.py databases/large.csv sequences/5.txt
Lavender
```

```
$ python dna.py
Usage: python dna.py data.csv sequence.txt
```

Where databases and sequences are provided by CS50 team.

#### Compiling And Execution:

To run a program we wrote in Python, weâ€™ll only need to run:

```Python
$ python dna.py data.csv sequence.txt
```

```python``` is the name of a program called an interpreter, which reads in our source code and translates it to code that our CPU can understand, line by line.\
```data.csv``` is the database to search, and  ```sequence.txt``` is the dna the DNA to be scanned in this database.
